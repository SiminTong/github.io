	<br><p>On this page, I will irregularly share some papers/videos that I find are interesting and the excerpt notes (generated by MarginNote 3 or written by hands) I took when I read/watch them. </p></br>
	<!--  . In August, I read papers on ALMA survey of Lupus protoplanetary disks and an Annual review paper on structures of protoplanetary disks.-->	
		
	<h5>Oct. 2021</h5>
	
	<br><p2> Read an ARAA paper about the inner region of the protoplanetary disk published 10 years ago: <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-astro-081309-130932">The Inner Regions of Protoplanetary Disks</a>. It's a theory-oriented review paper and includes a lot of details that are unfamiliar to me. But it is still very useful and can be helpful to understand some NIR observational work, like the below one :) I also took notes when reading it and am organizing it. I will share it soon.</p2></br>
	
	<br><p2>Read a paper about the observation of the famous and well-studied Herbig Ae star HD163296 by VLTI/MATTISE: <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A&A...647A..56V/abstract">The asymmetric inner disk of the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 in the eyes of VLTI/MATISSE: evidence for a vortex?</a>. I knew this work from the weekly observatory seminar at my institute in early 2021. However, I didn't read it until now (feel sorry for that :p) I was amazed by the detection of the rotating asymmetry in the L-band. Although I still have a lot of questions on the technical details, this paper confirms my earlier hypothesis that the reason why we don't directly do the imaging but modelling is that the uv coverage is very sparse. Indeed, we have more than 40 elements in the ALMA but only 4 for the MATISSE :)</p2></br>
	
	<br><p2>Read a few chapters of a book <i><a href = "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_PhD_Is_Not_Enough.html?id=ITOb1M1JXkUC&redir_esc=y">A PhD Is Not Enough!: A Guide to Survival in Science</i></a> shared by <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~kezhang/career_resources.html#wa-anchor-top"> Dr. (Ke) Zhang</a>. It's a helpful and easy-to-follow book, giving suggestions for different stages of an academic career. Using the author's words, this book is to help "naive, idealistic, and very bright young persons who generally choose a science major" survive in academia.</p2></br>
	
	<br><p2>Starting reading Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) serial papers. The first three I will read is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06268">MAPS I: Program Overview and Highlights</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06210">MAPS III: Characteristics of Radial Chemical Substructures</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06217"> MAPS IV: Emission Surfaces and Vertical Distribution of Molecules</a>. These papers are always long but not tedius at all! Really want to finish them soon! But still have a lot of assignment to work on :(</p2></br>

	
	<h5>Sept. 2021</h5>
		
	<br><p2>Recently watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/yLgkiAYfP7M"> talk on Youtube</a> given by Dr. (Myriam) Benisty in CfA colloquim (hosted by Prof. (Sean) Andrews) in 2020. It's about the multi-wavelength high-angular resolution observation of protoplanetary disk structures with VLT/SPHERE and ALMA. I have only worked on the ALMA data till now and have no hands-on experience on the optical data of scattered light from disks. This talk gives a very comprehensive introduction to the multi-wavelength study on disks, especially the study about scattering emission from disks. Hope I could have opportunities to study disks from wavelengths other than millimeter someday as well :) (<a href="AboutPageAssets/documents/paper-reading/CfA_colloquim_Benisty.pdf">Notes</a> can be found here.)</p2></br>
	<br><p2> Another talk also given by Dr. (Myrian) Benisty (with Prof. (Til) Birnstiel giving the introduction to the theoretical background in the first section) during the Sagan Summer Workshop can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/dSGR369WsKE">here (Youtube)</a>. Examples/Figures given in the talk are very helpful to understand several physical processes related to dust for a beginner. Notes taken by myself when watching the video can be found <a href="AboutPageAssets/documents/paper-reading/Sagan_Workshop_Benisty.pdf">here</a> (Figures in notes are extracted from the speaker's slides).</p2></br>
	<br>---------------------------------</br>
	<p2> Several amazing talks on circumstellar disks given by experts during the Sagan Summer Workshop can be found on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SaganSummerWorkshop">Youtube Channel</a>. Here I share some of them, for which I took notes when I watched them.</p2>
	<p2>
	<br><a href="https://youtu.be/JpjTGpTN4eM">Debris Disks as Planetary Signposts (theories)</a> by Prof. (Mark) Wyatt (Notes is under organization)</br>
	<br><a href="https://youtu.be/VN0TBcN2oRk">Debris Disks as Planetary Signposts(Observations)</a> by Dr. (Alycia) Weinberger (Notes is under organization)</br>
	<br><a href="https://youtu.be/DubszdHuARY">Techniques, Observations, and Diagnostics of Protoplanetary Disks: Inner Disk</a> by Dr. (Joan) Najita. The spectroastrometry technique shared in the talk is very inspiring! (<a href="AboutPageAssets/documents/paper-reading/Sagan_Workshop_inner_ppd.pdf">Notes</a>, figures in notes are extracted from the speaker's slides)</br> 
	</p2>
	<br>---------------------------------</br>
	<p2>I read a few papers on the disk survey during the summer break but have never expected to really work on a disk survey on my own. I am so excited to take one project on the disk survey from my supervisor, Dr. (Nienke) van der Marel, for this academic year! Thanks, Nienke!</p2>
